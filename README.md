To ensure the file operates with the necessary permissions, right-click on the file and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu. This step is crucial because running as an administrator allows the file to access protected system areas and make changes that would otherwise be restricted. Without administrative privileges, the file may not function as
 intended, potentially leading to errors or incomplete operations.
